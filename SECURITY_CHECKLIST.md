# Security Checklist ✅

## Overview
This checklist ensures all secrets and sensitive information are properly secured in the LushHeirLoom project.

## ✅ Completed Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- [x] Moved Supabase URL to `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` environment variable
- [x] Moved Supabase anonymous key to `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variable
- [x] Moved Supabase access token to `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable
- [x] Moved project reference to `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` environment variable

### Code Security
- [x] Removed hardcoded Supabase URL from `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- [x] Removed hardcoded anonymous key from `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- [x] Added environment variable validation in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- [x] Updated all script files to use environment variables:
  - [x] `test-setup.js`
  - [x] `setup-complete.js`
  - [x] `debug-auth.js`
  - [x] `test-complete.js`
  - [x] `fix-rls.js`

### Configuration Security
- [x] Updated `.vscode/mcp.json` to use environment variable substitution
- [x] Removed hardcoded access token from MCP configuration
- [x] Removed hardcoded project reference from MCP args

### Git Security
- [x] Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- [x] Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent secret exposure
- [x] Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- [x] Ensured no secrets are tracked in version control

### Dependencies
- [x] Installed `dotenv` package for environment variable loading in scripts
- [x] Added proper error handling for missing environment variables

### Documentation
- [x] Created `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` with setup instructions
- [x] Created security checklist (this file)
- [x] Documented all required environment variables

## 🔍 Security Verification

### Files Checked for Hardcoded Secrets
- [x] `src/lib/supabase.ts` - ✅ Clean
- [x] `test-setup.js` - ✅ Clean
- [x] `setup-complete.js` - ✅ Clean  
- [x] `debug-auth.js` - ✅ Clean
- [x] `test-complete.js` - ✅ Clean
- [x] `fix-rls.js` - ✅ Clean
- [x] `.vscode/mcp.json` - ✅ Clean

### Environment Files
- [x] `.env` - Contains actual secrets (git-ignored)
- [x] `.env.example` - Contains only placeholders (safe to commit)

### Git Status
- [x] `.env` file is properly ignored
- [x] No secrets are tracked in git history
- [x] All hardcoded values have been removed

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

### Access Control
- [x] Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies active
- [x] Admin-only access to sensitive operations
- [x] Google OAuth for customer authentication
- [x] Email/password for admin authentication

### API Security
- [x] Using anonymous keys for public operations
- [x] Service role keys not exposed in frontend
- [x] Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

### Environment Separation
- [x] Different configurations for development/production
- [x] Environment-specific variable loading
- [x] Clear separation of public vs private keys

## 🚨 Security Warnings

### What NOT to do:
- ❌ Never commit `.env` files
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets in source code
- ❌ Never share access tokens publicly
- ❌ Never use production keys in development

### Regular Security Tasks:
- 🔄 Rotate Supabase access tokens quarterly
- 🔄 Monitor Supabase logs for unusual activity
- 🔄 Review and update RLS policies as needed
- 🔄 Keep dependencies updated for security patches

## ✨ Additional Security Recommendations

### For Production:
1. Use different Supabase projects for staging/production
2. Implement proper monitoring and alerting
3. Regular security audits of database policies
4. Consider implementing rate limiting
5. Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures

### For Team Collaboration:
1. Use secret management tools for team environments
2. Document onboarding process for new developers
3. Regular security training for team members
4. Code review process to catch potential security issues

## 🎯 Verification Commands

To verify your setup is secure:

```bash
# Check if .env is properly ignored
git status

# Verify no secrets in tracked files
grep -r "eyJ" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude=".env" .
grep -r "sbp_" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude=".env" .

# Test environment variable loading
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('✅ Environment variables loaded successfully')"
```

## ✅ Final Security Status: SECURE 🔐

All sensitive information has been moved to environment variables and is properly protected. The application is ready for secure deployment.
